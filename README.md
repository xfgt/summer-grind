# Forge of future

<p>
    After my first year in university, I decided to practice the knowledge that I've gained, which was mainly in DSA, OOP and STL containers in C++.
</p>

## Why?
<p>
    The repository is created for the sake of self-improvement, but also as a compensation for not uploading all my homeworks that I've been working on during the year.
    The problem is that I was constantly switching different IDEs in order to find a good field with which I would form the right habits as well as having my files well-organised and flexible.

* I might consider adding some old files here in the near future.
</p>


## Goal
<p>
The goal is simple - practice all programming concepts by solving different problems from the Internet & upload all the progress every single day.
