After my first year in university, I decided to practice the knowledge that I've gained which is mainly in DSA, OOP and C++ containers.

It is created for the sake of self-improvement, but also as a compensation for not uploading all the homeworks that I've been working on during that year.
The problem is that I was constantly switching different IDEs in order to find optimal way for keeping my files organised and being relatively small size.<br>
Of course, I can just upload everything that I've been doing, but it is pointless, because it's just a single commit, and there is no way to express the progress that has been going through these files.


I will try to stick to this repo by solving problems daily, then we'll see how it would turn out!
