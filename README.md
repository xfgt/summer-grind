<p>After my first year in university, I decided to practice the knowledge that I've gained which was mainly in DSA,<br>
OOP and STL containers on C++.</p>

<p>
The repository is created for the sake of self-improvement, but also as a compensation for not uploading all my
homeworks that I've been working on during the year.
The problem is that I was constantly switching different IDEs in order to find a good field which would form me the right habits as well as keeping my files well-organised and flexible.
</p>

<p>Of course, I can just upload everything that I've been doing, but it is pointless, because it's just a single commit, and there is no way to express the progress that has been going through these files.</p>


<p>I will try to stick to this repo by solving problems daily and upload a picture of the results, then we'll see how it would turn out!</p>
